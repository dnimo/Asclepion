# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Background and Motivation

East Asian societies are facing a profound demographic transformation—accelerated aging and rising healthcare costs—which presents a critical challenge: **How can we maximize the efficiency of healthcare resource allocation under limited resources, while upholding fairness, justice, and patient welfare as core ethical principles?**

Traditional hospital management models, with their focus on economic rationality, often fall into the trap of prioritizing economic efficiency above all else. This makes it difficult to reconcile the complex and sometimes conflicting interests of diverse stakeholders such as doctors, trainees, administrators, finance departments, and patients. The challenge thus transcends mere operational optimization and becomes a **system design problem**: **How can we construct a robust systemic architecture that organically integrates ethical norms, professional knowledge, and material resources?**

## 1.2 Paradigm Shift and Theoretical Perspective

This system design problem can be mathematically characterized as **an evolutionary problem of a complex adaptive system**. In this view, the system is not a static machine to be simply optimized, but an evolving organism composed of multiple adaptive agents interacting nonlinearly.

This theoretical insight prompts a fundamental shift in research paradigm: from seeking a single, static “optimal solution” to exploring the system’s dynamic **resilience**. The research focus thus moves from the pursuit of an ideal end state to the analysis of mechanisms that maintain dynamic stability and adaptability under various disturbances.

## 1.3 Structure and Value of This Study

Based on the theory of complex adaptive systems, this study aims to construct an analytical framework to identify and describe the structural features of healthcare systems that maintain robustness in uncertain environments. The paper first analyzes the failure mechanisms of current hospital management models in coordinating multiple stakeholders and integrating heterogeneous elements; then, by introducing key concepts such as adaptability, emergence, and robustness, it reformalizes the definition of an “acceptable operational state” for healthcare systems; finally, it explores possible paths and design principles for achieving system resilience.

The significance of this research lies in providing a new, dynamic, and more realistic theoretical lens for understanding and addressing the healthcare resource dilemma in aging societies, with the goal of informing policy and management practice.

### 2.1.1 Language as a Carrier of Knowledge: From Representation to Dynamic System Design

Language is not knowledge itself, but the **carrier and encoding medium** of knowledge. Just as DNA carries genetic information, language encodes human experience, concepts, and cognitive patterns. Large Language Models (LLMs) do not directly “understand” knowledge from massive corpora, but internalize **patterns of arrangement and conditional combinations of knowledge**—the latent structures of co-occurrence and interaction of concepts in specific contexts. When a model receives a key sequence or symbol, it **activates related knowledge clusters** in its parameter space and dynamically infers the next generation direction based on context and probability distributions. Thus, knowledge in such models is not statically stored, but is **dynamically organized and reconstructed** through the interaction of language and context.

This mechanism provides an important **cognitive analogy** for the design of complex multi-agent systems. Just as language models dynamically generate coherent knowledge under constraints, multi-agent frameworks can be seen as distributed generative systems: doctors, nurses, patients, and managers continuously update their strategies through local interactions and negotiations, leading to emergent order and intelligence at the system level. A virtual hospital, therefore, should not be viewed as a simple optimization problem, but as a **social system with linguistic characteristics**, whose governance evolves through iterative communication, consensus formation, and adaptive learning.

To guide this evolutionary process, we introduce a **virtual value system** analogous to semantic constraints in language generation. This system is oriented toward efficiency and optimal configuration, while embedding ethical boundaries to prevent crossing moral lines in pursuit of efficiency. Similar to the reference function $r(t)$ in control theory, the virtual value system dynamically calibrates agent behavior to maintain coordination between efficiency and ethics. It serves as both a **normative regulator** and a **stabilizing core** for global semantic consistency.

Unlike traditional control theory, which seeks monotonic convergence, our framework emphasizes that **oscillation, adaptation, and feedback** are intrinsic manifestations of system resilience and learning ability. A healthy virtual hospital system does not remain static at a single point, but maintains acceptable operation under various disturbances. System health should be measured not only by efficiency and fairness, but also by:

- **Resilience** (speed of recovery from disturbances)
- **Adaptability** (ability to learn new strategies)
- **Diversity** (reserve of strategies for different challenges)
- **Modularity** (local failures do not affect the whole)

These indicators echo the mechanisms by which language models maintain coherence and creativity in changing contexts: system stability arises not from stasis, but from continuous reorganization and evolution.

Ultimately, this study seeks to unify the **epistemological structure of language** with the **engineering design of adaptive governance systems**. It transforms hospital management from a closed optimization task into an **open generative process**—a dynamic system in which ethics, knowledge, and efficiency are co-regulated through interaction. This philosophy underpins the “Kallipolis Medical Republic” model, where philosophy, control theory, and AI converge to explore the dynamic balance between moral order and system efficiency.

### 2.1.2 System Model and Mathematical Formulation

#### System Definition and State Space

The hospital is modeled as a multi-agent dynamic system, with state vector:

$$
x(t) = [x_1(t), x_2(t), \dots, x_n(t)]^\top \in \mathbb{R}^n
$$

where each component represents key performance indicators such as resource utilization, patient wait time, financial status, ethical compliance, and training outcomes. The agent set is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{A} = \{\text{Doctor}, \text{Intern}, \text{Accountant}, \text{Government Agent}, \text{Patient}\}
$$

Each agent $i \in \mathcal{A}$ observes a local state $o_i \in \mathcal{O}_i$ and selects actions $a_i \in \mathcal{A}_i(t)$ according to policy $\pi_i(a_i | o_i)$.

#### Dynamic Governance by the Holy Code

The **Holy Code (HC)** is a time-varying set of rules:

$$
HC(t) = \{(R_k, W_k, C_k)\}_{k=1}^K
$$

where $R_k$ is a rule function, $W_k$ is a weight, and $C_k$ is the applicable context. The ideal system state $x^*(t)$ is defined as:

$$
x^*(t) = \arg\min_{x} \sum_{k=1}^K W_k \cdot \mathbb{I}_{C_k}(x,d(t)) \cdot |R_k(x) - R_k^*|^2
$$

ensuring that system evolution under disturbance $d(t)$ remains within ethical and operational constraints.

#### Multi-Agent Game and LLM-Generated Actions

Each agent’s action set $\mathcal{A}_i(t)$ is **dynamically generated by an LLM** based on local observation $o_i$ and system context:

$$
\mathcal{A}_i(t) = \text{LLM}(o_i, x_{1:t-1}, HC_{1:t-1})
$$

The policy $\pi_i(a_i | o_i; \theta_i)$ is defined as a probability distribution over $\mathcal{A}_i(t)$:

$$
\pi_i(a_i | o_i; \theta_i) = \frac{\exp(\phi_i(o_i, a_i)^\top \theta_i)}{\sum_{a_i' \in \mathcal{A}_i(t)} \exp(\phi_i(o_i, a_i')^\top \theta_i)}
$$

where $\phi_i$ is a feature mapping and $\theta_i$ is the policy parameter. The reward function is:

$$
R_i(x, a_i, a_{-i}) = \alpha_i U(x) + \beta_i V_i(x, a_i) - \gamma_i D_i(x, x^*)
$$

LLM-generated action sets $\mathcal{A}_i(t)$ enhance system adaptability and innovation, enabling agents to explore new strategy combinations in complex environments.

#### Distributed Learning and Control

Policy gradient update:

$$
\nabla_{\theta_i} J_i(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \big[ \nabla_{\theta_i} \log \pi_i(a_i|o_i) Q_i(x, a_i, a_{-i}) \big]
$$

Distributed control law:

$$
\theta_i(t+1) = \theta_i(t) + \eta \nabla_{\theta_i} J_i(\theta(t))
$$

Extended state vector:

$$
z(t) = [x^\top, \theta_1^\top, \dots, \theta_4^\top]^\top
$$

Lyapunov analysis ensures asymptotic stability and robustness, even with LLM-generated action sets.

#### Parliamentary Decision Modeling

The parliament is modeled as a cooperative game, with seat set $\mathcal{N}$ and characteristic function $v: 2^{\mathcal{N}} \to \mathbb{R}$. Consensus converges under the core condition:

$$
\sum_{i \in S} w_i \geq v(S), \quad \forall S \subset \mathcal{N}
$$

Convergence rate is related to the algebraic connectivity $\lambda_2(L)$ of the parliament Laplacian $L$.

#### Optimal Evolution of the Holy Code

The optimal control problem for Holy Code evolution:

$$
\min_{HC(t)} \int_0^T e^{-\rho t} \Big[ |x(t) - x^*(t)|^2_Q + |HC(t) - HC(t-1)|^2_R \Big] dt
$$

subject to system dynamics:

$$
\dot{z}(t) = f(z(t), HC(t), d(t))
$$

Solving via Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation or model predictive control yields **Pareto-optimal and ethically constrained system evolution**. With LLM-generated action sets, the system achieves efficient governance in complex, dynamic environments.
